                    <p class="resumePara">I am an experienced multi-lingual professional with several years of international experience in localization project management, who has been pursuing a career-change to become a successful web developer. While my professional expertise
                        prior to December 2016 was in translation and localization project management, working across every single timezone and communicating in multiple languages and across many time zones certainly gives one an intimate look into the
                        challenges of organizing an effective team. My success in organizing and supervising my teams has been proven by being rewarded with progressive promotions throughout my career. As a student at Skill Distillery, I have worked on
                        a range of individual and group projects to develop web-based applications from design to implementation to deployment. Beyond my hands-on experience with Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and SQL, this also includes building and maintaining
                        relational SDL databases, test-driven development using the JUnit library, building RESTful APIs, and implementing dynamic frontend solutions with AngularJS. While I am extremely excited to begin my career as a developer, I am
                        very cognizant of the fact that I still have much to learn about development, so I push myself to ask questions until I have a full understanding of the problem I am trying to solve. I have been commended by instructors at Skill
                        Distillery for my perseverance and my ability to quickly catch on to complex topics. I have always placed a high importance on continuing education, so I fully intend to pursue professional certifications in the near future as
                        well as to continue participating in local meetup groups.</p>

                            The app gives users a streamlined way to keep track of all of their active job applications and job postings that the user is interested in. Users can add jobs to an index that stores all of the relevant information about that
                            job.
